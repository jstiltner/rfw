              h2 Hard Water
              p The most common problem found in water may be hardness.  It is generally associated with an abundance of limestone, calcium and/or magnesium dissolved in the water. Hard water causes deposits that form on pipes and other plumbing fixtures, and is the cause of those unsightly water spots on your shower door and sink.  When using hard water, more soap or detergent is needed to get things like your hands, hair and laundry clean.  Water treatment will rid your home of hard water.

              p You would know it if you had this problem! In some parts of the country, drinking water can contain the chemical hydrogen sulfide gas, which will fill your home with a "rotten egg" smell.  Water treatment is the only solution to address sulfur.

              p Does the smell of your water give you flashbacks to summer days spent by the pool?  If so, itâ€™s likely that that you have high levels of chlorine in your drinking water.  Water treatment is the only way to ensure chemicals are removed from your water.
